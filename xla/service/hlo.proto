// This proto file defines messages which represent the HLO module. This is a
// full fidelity serialization of the c++ HLO constructs.
//
// Many of the protos below are simple 1-to-1 serializations of the
// corresponding C++ classes, e.g., HloModule, HloComputation, and
// HloInstruction.
//
// FIELD NAMES ARE IMPORTANT
//
// Unlike most protos, you can't safely change the names of fields, even if you
// keep the numeric ids the same. This is because we sometimes serialize these
// protos as JSON, which includes the field names in the serialization.
